##Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge 🚀##
#Day 1 – Platform Setup & First Steps (09/01/26)

This repository documents Day 1 of my Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge, focused on setting up the Databricks platform and understanding its core concepts.

📌 Day 1 Objectives

- Understand why Databricks is preferred over Pandas and Hadoop
- Learn Lakehouse architecture fundamentals
- Explore Databricks workspace structure
- Study real-world industry use cases
- Perform basic hands-on tasks using PySpark

#📚 What I Learned
1.Why Databricks vs Pandas/Hadoop?
Pandas works on a single machine and is not scalable
Hadoop is complex and slower for analytics
Databricks provides scalable, distributed processing optimized for big data and AI

2.Lakehouse Architecture
Combines data lake flexibility with data warehouse performance
Supports analytics, machine learning, and AI on the same data
Databricks Workspace Structure
Unified platform with notebooks, clusters, jobs, and data access
Simplifies collaboration and workflow management

3.Industry Use Cases
Netflix: recommendation systems and real-time analytics
Shell: large-scale data processing and predictive analytics
Comcast: customer insights and AI-driven decision making

#🛠️ Hands-on Tasks Completed

1.Created a Databricks Community Edition account
2.Navigated Workspace, Compute, and Data Explorer
3.Created the first Databricks notebook
4.Executed basic PySpark commands

#🧠 Key Takeaway

Databricks simplifies big data and AI development by unifying data engineering, analytics, and machine learning on a single Lakehouse platform, making it easier to scale from experimentation to production.
