## 📘 What I Learned

- **Descriptive Statistics**  
  Learned how to summarize data using measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution analysis.

- **Hypothesis Testing**  
  Understood how to test assumptions and compare groups using statistical significance, such as analyzing weekday versus weekend behavior.

- **A/B Test Design**  
  Learned how to design experiments by defining control and treatment groups along with measurable success metrics.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Learned how to create meaningful features from raw data to improve machine learning model effectiveness.
