# 📅 Day 12 – MLflow Basics

## 📌 Overview
Day 12 focused on understanding MLflow and its role in managing the machine learning lifecycle. The objective was to learn how to track experiments, log models, and compare results in a reproducible and structured way.

## 📘 What I Learned

- **MLflow Components**  
  Learned about MLflow Tracking for experiments, MLflow Models for packaging models, and the Model Registry for versioning and lifecycle management.

- **Experiment Tracking**  
  Understood how logging parameters and metrics enables systematic comparison of multiple model runs.

- **Model Logging**  
  Learned how trained models can be stored along with metadata to support reuse and deployment.

- **MLflow UI**  
  Explored the MLflow UI to visualize experiment history, compare runs, and analyze performance metrics.
