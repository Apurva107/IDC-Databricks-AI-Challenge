## What I Learned
- **Training multiple models**  
  Compared different regression algorithms to understand their strengths and limitations on the same dataset.

- **Hyperparameter tuning**  
  Learned how adjusting model parameters can significantly improve model performance.

- **Feature importance**  
  Identified which features have the most influence on predictions, improving both model accuracy and interpretability.

- **Spark ML Pipelines**  
  Built scalable and reusable machine learning pipelines that combine feature preparation, training, and evaluation.
